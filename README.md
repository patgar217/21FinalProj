# Flappy Bird Vol. 2
This is a Flappy Bird Rendition using Python's Turtle feature

This application was created as a requirement for CMSC 21.
The added feature to the known Flappy Bird game is that the
barriers are moving vertically and that the speed increases 
as more points are collected. 

P.S. I created this application during my first year so it might
not be the best and has glitches.
